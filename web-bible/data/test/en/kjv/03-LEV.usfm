\v 1 And the LORD called unto Moses, and spake unto him out of the tabernacle of the congregation, saying,
\v 2 Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, If any man of you bring an offering unto the LORD, ye shall bring
your offering of the cattle, \add even\add* of the herd, and of the flock.
\v 3 If his offering \add be\add* a burnt sacrifice of the herd, let him offer a male without blemish: he shall offer it of his
own voluntary will at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation before the LORD.
\v 4 And he shall put his hand upon the head of the burnt offering; and it shall be accepted for him to make atonement for him.
\v 5 And he shall kill the bullock before the LORD: and the priests, Aaronâ€™s sons, shall bring the blood, and sprinkle the
blood round about upon the altar that \add is by\add* the door of the tabernacle of the congregation.
