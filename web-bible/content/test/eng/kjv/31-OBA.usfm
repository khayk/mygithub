\v 1 The vision of Obadiah. Thus saith the Lord GOD concerning Edom; We have heard a rumour from the LORD, and an ambassador is
sent among the heathen, Arise ye, and let us rise up against her in battle.
\v 2 Behold, I have made thee small among the heathen: thou art greatly despised.
\p
\v 3 The pride of thine heart hath deceived thee, thou that dwellest in the clefts of the rock, whose habitation
\add is\add* high; that saith in his heart, Who shall bring me down to the ground?
\v 4 Though thou exalt \add thyself\add* as the eagle, and though thou set thy nest among the stars, thence will I bring thee
down, saith the LORD.
\v 5 If thieves came to thee, if robbers by night, (how art thou cut off!) would they not have stolen till they had enough? if
the grapegatherers came to thee, would they not leave \add some\add* grapes?
\v 6 How are \add the things\add* of Esau searched out! \add how\add* are his hidden things sought up!
\v 7 All the men of thy confederacy have brought thee \add even\add* to the border: the men that were at peace with thee have
deceived thee, \add and\add* prevailed against thee; \add they that
eat\add* thy bread have laid a wound under thee: \add there is\add* none understanding in him.
\v 8 Shall I not in that day, saith the LORD, even destroy the wise
\add men\add* out of Edom, and understanding out of the mount of Esau?
\v 9 And thy mighty \add men\add*, O Teman, shall be dismayed, to the end that every one of the mount of Esau may be cut off by
slaughter.
\p
\v 10 For \add thy\add* violence against thy brother Jacob shame shall cover thee, and thou shalt be cut off for ever.
